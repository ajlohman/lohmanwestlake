On going support through college
Sometimes, students are not aware of their natural strengths. Once your student realizes personal strengths, self-confidence soars and choices become clearer. Choosing a major or career as well as a college should not be done randomly.

We support your navigation through the college maze and clarify time-lines. Personal attention throughout the process and follow-up prepares you to make good decisions for a rewarding future.

Coaches complete the assessments with you in person, interpret the results, and discuss the findings. We stick with you until you graduate from college.
